Here's a website body with an online resume covering the aspects you mentioned:

```html

In this example, I've created a section called `resume` that contains the following elements:

- `summary`: Includes an objective or summary statement about your goals and interests.
- `education`: Lists your education background, including the school name and graduation year.
- `work-experience`: Since you mentioned "No work experience," I've included a note stating that you're actively seeking opportunities in web design and development.
- `skills`: Lists your skills related to web creation, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and UX design.

You can further customize the content and styling of this online resume to fit your specific needs and personal branding.
